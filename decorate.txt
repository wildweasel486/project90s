// PROJECT NINETIES
// by wildweasel
// based on too many 199x wads to count
// THE GOING RULES:
// 1. Resources must ONLY be from WAD files between 1994 and 1997,
//    except for sound files which must have been date stamped no later
//    than 1995.
// 2. Resources must ONLY receive minor modifications if desperately needed.
//    I may not correct for noise reduction, apply filters, remove
//    clicks or pops, or significantly redraw any graphic. Modifications
//    may involve cropping, realigning, and color translation.
// 3. DO YOUR BEST YOU HAVE EVER BEEN
