Credits - These are the WADs I borrowed material from. As usual this is
a work in progress and I will be doing a full audit once I've decided
what all's staying and what's getting deleted.

D2ENH10 - Large bullet puff sprites.
Hell To Pay - Several enemy sprites, and the "fart gun."
Doom Must Fall - The unfinished rocket launcher.
Strain - Borrowed a couple enemy sprites.
Kick Attack - Various enemy sprites, and "Spew!" clouds.
Marine Doom - The M16
The Sky May Be/Kansam's Trial - Many sound effects
Geek Doom - Sound effects
Doom Gold 15 Bright - Sound effects
Aliens Doom, Aliens TC, AvPvT and many other Aliens mods - Sound effects
Aliens TC - Smartgun sprites
The Innocent Crew - Flamethrower and other things

To Be Determined:
- The rest of the enemy sprites
- Any other weapons I plan on adding
- Where'd the HMG come from?
- ????
